# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT PROJECT

The project incorporates Spring Boot as the backend framework, MySQL as the database management system, and React JS as the frontend framework. With this project, users can efficiently manage library subscribers and the books they can subscribe to.

The backend, powered by Spring Boot, provides a solid foundation for the project's functionality. It offers a scalable and secure API for seamless data management, authentication, and authorization. Leveraging the power of Spring Boot, the project ensures efficient communication between the frontend and the database.

MySQL serves as the project's database, offering a reliable and efficient storage solution. It enables the storage and retrieval of subscriber and book-related information, ensuring the integrity and availability of data. MySQL's relational nature allows for the establishment of meaningful connections between subscribers and the books they subscribe to, facilitating efficient management and retrieval of relevant data.

The frontend is developed using React JS, providing users with an intuitive and interactive interface. Through the frontend, users can easily navigate through the library's offerings, manage subscribers, and oversee book subscriptions. The use of React JS ensures a smooth user experience by enabling dynamic rendering and responsive design, resulting in a visually appealing and highly functional frontend.

Overall, this Library Management Project demonstrates the effective utilization of Spring Boot, MySQL, and React JS. It empowers library administrators with a comprehensive solution to efficiently manage subscribers and their book subscriptions, ultimately enhancing the overall library experience.
